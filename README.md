## Echo is a crime prediction, alert, and prevention
platform designed for SRM KTR University students. Through
an interactive crime map, incidents of womenâ€™s safety
concerns, theft, and drug abuse are highlighted with ripple
markers that spread like echoes of disturbance across and around
the campus. The platform issues real-time alertswhen a user enters
a hotspot, while a one-tap SOS system notifies police and nearby
peers to trigger an immediate response. Alongside a live crime
feed and a helpline directory, Echo ensures that no incident goes
unnoticed, no call for help goes unheard, and every student
feels empowered to act against crime. ##
