# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        - comment: "ENHANCED ACTION BUTTON LOGIC TESTING FAILED ❌ Critical issues found in improved intent detection logic: 1) OVERLAPPING INTENT DETECTION - Emergency intent detection is too broad, catching 'help' keyword in general conversations like 'Thank you for your help' (should be general intent with no buttons, but gets emergency intent with Call 100/SOS Alert buttons). 2) SOS/HELPLINES INTENT CONFLICTS - Messages like 'I need helplines' and 'Need emergency numbers' incorrectly trigger emergency intent instead of sos_help intent due to 'help'/'emergency' keywords being checked before 'helplines'/'emergency numbers' patterns. 3) INTENT PRIORITY ORDER ISSUE - The if-elif chain in lines 804-822 of server.py has emergency intent (line 808) checked before sos_help intent (line 815), causing keyword conflicts. SPECIFIC FAILURES: 'Thank you for your help' → emergency (should be general), 'I need helplines' → emergency (should be sos_help), 'Need emergency numbers' → emergency (should be sos_help). WORKING CORRECTLY: Report-specific requests properly show Report Incident buttons, Map-specific requests properly show View Map buttons, Pure SOS messages work correctly. IMPACT: Action buttons appear inappropriately in general conversations, breaking the enhanced contextual logic requirement."

Widget now only starts dragging after mouse moves beyond 5px threshold, allowing normal clicks to work properly. Modal opens with custom positioning relative to widget position, supports draggable widget with position persistence, includes full chat interface with language selection, and maintains all original functionality. The issue was NOT a React import problem but a event handling conflict between dragging and clicking functionality."

Minor Issues: Quick buttons slightly small for mobile touch targets (32px height vs 44px recommended), position persistence on mobile needs improvement (resets to default after reload). All core functionality working perfectly with excellent backend integration and user experience."
